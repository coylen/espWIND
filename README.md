Code for a custom circuit which decodes data from a NASA Marine Clipper Wind repeater socket and uploads the data to a WiFI NMEA Server.

This code requires the following additional dependencies:
  - A custom ESP8266 Micropython build with I2C Slave support from github/coylen/micropython
  - nmeagenerator.py from github.com/coylen/upyNMEA
